Program: Password Cracker

**************************
** What is this program **
**************************
This program is used to demonstrate how tougher passwords will take much longer to crack using hash comparing than non tough passwords.
For the sake of this program, a tough password is one that consists of multiple words just strung together.  I use a list of 10,000
of the most common passwords and do basic transformations and cracks against them and calculate how long that takes.  I then do all possible
2 word combinations of the 10,000, which adds up to 49,995,000 combinations.  I generate a report showing how much longer it takes to do
that, what appears to be simple, modification to the list and check against those new words.  I then extrapolate that data in the report to 
estimate how long it would take to do all possible 3 word combinations in the english dictionary, which is 8.4033255e+14 possible combinations.

** Output of the proram **
**************************
1) This program generates a report discussing the before mentioned topics
2) At the end of execution, it will also generate a line graph to demonstrate the relational differences in the times taken to run each test

******* How to use *******
**************************
1) Run the program with "passInput.txt" as a command line argument
2) Select your desired hashing algoritm (md5 is the current test file)
3) Decide if you would like to do the word combining example.  The graph looks much better if you do not, and the test takes about 20 minutes
	so only reply with "y" if you have time to wait.
4) Program will run through tests, and will generate a file called PasswordCrackReport.txt with all of the cracked passwords and times it took for 
	each test.
5) Program will also generate a graph upon completion of the last test
